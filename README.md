# EEG Uncertainty Estimation

This repo contains code for Article III of my PhD, focusing on uncertainty in deep learning models for EEG.

## Overview

We explore how different ensemble strategies and Bayesian approaches quantify uncertainty in EEG-based classification. The models are evaluated under controlled dataset shifts to assess robustness and calibration.

## Data

The dataset can be requested from: \url{https://github.com/ipis-mjkim/caueeg-dataset}
