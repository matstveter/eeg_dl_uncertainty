# This project involves Uncertainty, Deep Learning and EEG

The aim of this project is to explore relevant analysis of uncertainty in the field of deep learning and EEG analysis. 
More specifically, this encompasses ensemble models and bayesian deep learning, where the aim is to both quantify
the aleatoric and the epistemic uncertainty.
